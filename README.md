Goal: Build a simple rule app that measures distance between 2 points
- We want a camera that takes input — done 
- We want to have a start point that starts our distance measurement — done
- We want to have a text that shows the distance from the first point to where user wants to end — done
- We want an end point that ends our distance measurement — done

Success:
- Able to perform action on swiftui button via linking with Coordinator
- Able to construct buttons on top of AR View using ZStack
- Able to pass calculation from coordinator to UI


Work to be done: 
- Seperate code logic better
- How to get measurement live, and not at the end of 2nd point
- How to ensure measurement only can be done when a surface is found

Utilised: SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit
